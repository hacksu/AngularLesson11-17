# Angular Lesson with Stackblitz
This lesson is to learn more about Angular, TypeScript-based open-source web application framework which generates part of the website into components for the Front End & Back End.
Below are the steps to set up Angular locally; however, for this lesson we are going to use Stackblitz. Stackblitz will allow for us to work with Angular and look at other frameworks without having to download anything.

# Stackblitz
Visit https://stackblitz.com/ to check out what can be created! This will link to your GitHub account to save progress on your projects so it is recommended to have a GitHub account. 

# Getting started with Angular locally
1. First install Angular with npm install -g @angular/cli

2. Create a new project with ng new “name”. Example, ng new ToDoList

3. To run and serve the application locally, ng serve 

4. Check out localhost:4200

# Let's Get Started!
1. When you get to Stackblitz look in the far left corner and click on Angular. This will direct you to a new Angular Project 
  Lets take about what we see!
      1. On the left hand side we have the files for our project, the middle is the text editor, and the far right is the ouput console
      2. All of our code is in the source folder and we have a angular.json file 
      3. Inside of the source folder we have the app folder which will hold all of our components. Then we have the index.html file which is currently set to load in the angular app, and the main.ts which is a type-sript file that does some nice stuff for us for loading and browser dynamics that I am not going to deep-drive into.
