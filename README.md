# Angular Lesson with Stackblitz
This lesson is to learn more about Angular, TypeScript-based open-source web application framework which generates part of the website into components for the Front End & Back End.
Below are the steps to set up Angular locally; however, for this lesson we are going to use Stackblitz. Stackblitz will allow for us to work with Angular and look at other frameworks without having to download anything.
